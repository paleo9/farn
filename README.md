farn
====

Farn files are pretty big, thousands of lines long. These scripts help to extract 
the few dozen lines that are of interest.
Go to farn, perform a search and save the resulting page. Then use FarnPageParser
parse_page(filename) to parse it. You can output it as a hash or a string, using
to_hash and to_s respectively.
