Complete rewrite. The result is a single class with two private nested classes
that can output a string and a hash. The hash is then to be used as a basis for
conversion to json, using the JSON gem.
* Deleted all existing ruby files, leaving only README.md and CHANGELOG.

## About farn_page_parser.rb 
  * the only ruby class required. 
  * includes rdoc for 100% documentation
  * passes rubocop tests
  * works on rows, the original version worked on columns. This was easier to 
    get working, but difficult to work with.
  * produces hash for use with json and mongodb 
  * fast and efficient
  * many more lines of code, but easier to follow
